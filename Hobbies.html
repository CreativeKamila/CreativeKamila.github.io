                <h2>Video games!</h2>I've been a fan of video games for ages now, my first ever console was a Leapfrog,
                of
                course. When I was a wee bit older, my grandma bought my siblings and I a Nintendo Wii. I remember
                loving just dance, LEGO Harry Potter, and of course Wii Sports Resort. Now that I'm a university
                student, my favourite video games are things like Stardew Valley, Hades, and my number one favourite,
                (GOTY 2024) Baldur's Gate Three</p>

                <h2>Achievement Hunting!</h2>As a huge fan of video games and a neurodivergent nerd, I am absolutely in
                love
                with
                100%-ing games. I play games on my gaming laptop (one day I'll have an actual PC). The first game I ever
                100%-ed was Hades, I'd give it a difficulty rating of 5/10, the whole game is about trial and error,
                with it being a Roguelike after all. I had 98% completion in Stardew Valley, but there is a new update
                that jsut came out, which means I will fall down the farming rabbit hole again soon enough. Currently,
                on BG3 (my beloved), I have 68% of the achievements, which I will already give a difficulty rating of
                8/10 since there are SO many playthroughs and small lil things that you have to do, with some of the
                achievements needing a playthrough on the most difficult setting with only ONE save...On a game that is
                infamous for people save-scumming (I'm guilty of this as well, don't @ me)</p>

                <h2>Anime!</h2>I remember loving Digimon and Pokemon (Indigo League and Black & White) as a kid. Some of
                my
                most
                nostalgic memories are watching
                Digimon while I play with Littlest Pet Shop on top of my Winnie The Pooh blanket when I was sick. In
                elementary school, I got into shows like Naruto, RWBY, and Ouran Highschool Host Club (kiss kiss, fall
                in love!). Nowadays, I love anime like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Chainsaw Man. I
                enjoy Shounen anime a little more than Shoujo anime, but I enjoy romance and drama anime every now and
                again. I'd just rather watch crazy anime battles with rock music in the background while I have rewind
                every two seconds because I was looking at the pretty colours and not the subtitles.</p>

                <p></p>
                <h2>Cartoons!</h2>Similar to anime, I've been watching cartoons for forever. I loved Justice
                League Unlimited, Powerpuff Girls, Teen Titans, TMNT, Ben10, Winx Club, Bratz, Monster High and Ever
                After
                High. Most of these shows I had toys for of course. I still hold a place in my heart for cartoons like
                Winx
                and Teen Titans, still making jokes about them with my family. The cartoons I love now are shows like
                Invincible, The Legend of Vox Machina, and Arcane, shows with more mature themes and topics, including
                more mature comedy. I absolutely ADORE cartoons, anime, and animation. I find the ability to create life
                through art amazing, and mesmerizing</p>

                <h2>Art!</h2>WEEWOOWEEWOO Awesome segue from the last topic, yessirrrrrrr! I love art, I've been
                drawing for an insanely long time, I have a shelf in my room that is FILLED with sketchbooks from over
                ten
                years ago to now. Art has helped me express myself, gotten me through tough times, and allowed me to
                explore
                my own mind, dude (read that last part with a surfer voice). One of my favourite artists of all time is
                Banksy. I went to see an exhbit about his work and I fell completely in love with the messages and
                rebellion
                he would show in his art. Other artists that I really enjoy are Alberto Mielgo for his work with the
                Spiderverse movies, and I love Fortiche Studios known for the show Arcane as well as their other work
                with
                Riot Games. My own art is inspired heavily by video games, anime, and video games, all things that I
                enjoy
                the art that I find within them as wella s things that have brought me immense joy throughout my life.
                Fun
                fact, my sister is also a huge inspiration for me as she would always draw as I was growing up. Being
                her
                little sister, of course I wanted to be just like her growing up, wanting to draw like her, etc. I
                remember
                during a road trip I was practically begging her to teach me how to draw. She is still a talented artist
                to
                this day, and I'm just as proud of her as she is of me.</p>
