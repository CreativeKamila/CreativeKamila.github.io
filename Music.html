                <h2>Metal</h2>I love metal because I'm a huge fan of quick paced music that fills me with energy, and
                metal
                does
                just that. I've been into metal music for a decent amount of time now, diving more into the classics of
                metal than I did in the past. However, I do prefer the more experimental nature and blend of genres that
                modern metal has to offer. I also really enjoy learning about the different subgenres and learning more
                about the metalhead subculture in general. My favourite metal bands are <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Ffb6ejR6Fe5IamqA5oRUF">Bring Me the Horizon</a>
                (Metalcore/Numetal), <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/05fG473iIaoy82BF1aGhL8">Slipknot</a>
                (Numetal), and
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ZznAOb4aE3va5Jz1iDpjc">Conquer Divide</a> (Metalcore)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="musicItems">
                <p>
                <h2>Pop</h2>I love any type of music I can dance to, anything groovy, anything a wee bit wibey, if you
                will.
                Pop music has always been a part of my life and it always will be, I can't help but enjoy a good pop bop
                every now and again!
                My
                favourite pop artists are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CwfuxIqcltXDGjfZsMd9A">Marina</a>,
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Raaw7kr1Vzat4ZvHzjsJR">IDKHBTFM</a>, and <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3PyJHH2wyfQK3WZrk9rpmP">Ashnikko</a>

                <h2>International</h2>I love music from around the world, no matter the genre. I especially love Kpop
                (Korean pop) and Jrock (Japanese rock). I love learning the words to songs in other languages, I find it
                to
                be a fun challenge. With Japanese, I can understand and read a decent amount of the lyrics which
                definitely
                makes it easier to sing along. Latin languages like Spanish and French are also easy to sing along to. I
                find the most challenging language to sing along to is Norwegian, but I think it sounds super cool!!! My
                favourite international artists are <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2dIgFjalVxs4ThymZ67YCE">Stray
                    Kids</a> (Kpop), <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6mEQK9m2krja6X1cfsAjfl">Ado</a> (Jrock),
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0lAWpj5szCSwM4rUMHYmrr">Måneskin</a> (Italian
                rock)</p>

            <div class="musicItems">
                <p>
                <h2>Alternative Rock</h2>I adore alt rock, I've been listening to it since childhood, and I still do to
                this
                day. Unlike with metal, it's more chill than it is aggressive, so it's definitely easier for most people
                to
                get into. My favourite part of rock is the sound of the guitars and vocals. Nothing makes me more
                energetic
                than hearing a strong vocal, it brings me so much joy. My favourite alt rock bands are <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4UXqAaa6dQYAk18Lv7PEgX">Fall Out
                    Boy</a>,
                and
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3AA28KZvwAUcZuOKwyblJQ">Gorillaz</a> </p>
            </div>

            <div class="musicItems">
                <p>
                <h2>Soundtracks</h2>From movies, to musicals, to video games, I. Love. Soundtracks! The way that music
                can
                take you into a whole new world (not an Aladdin reference, I swear) is absolutely breathtaking. I love
                soundtracks that have a whole variety of songs that fit the vibe of each scene perfectly. I especially
                love
                when original soundtracks create themes for characters, so that even if a character isn't on screen, you
                KNOW they're about to show up and do something cool (Spiderman 2099, anyone?). My favourite soundtracks
                are
                the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4pJT0WKggr4xk149X8A6KC">Persona 5</a> sountrack, the <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6JR4qLOXu96krMWxBTpXSR">Baldur's Gate Thre</a>e soundtrack
                (shocker), and the
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1kCHru7uhxBUdzkm4gzRQc">Hamilton</a>
                soundtrack (yes, I'm
                a theatre kid, can't you tell?)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="musicItems">
                <p>
                <h2>Covers</h2>One thing I love just as much as original songs are covers. Seeing the way that different
                artists tackle the same song really shows how everybody is unique and how music is adaptable, ESPECIALLY
                when those cover artists genrebend. There's something special about people putting their own spin to
                songs
                that are already known and loved, sometimes the covers end up being even better than the original! My
                favourite cover artists (who also do original music) are <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2IeMt1qx6ZVt1HFjdfE5tl">Johnathan Young</a>, <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6jDwZUFYUH1dC4xWzOd8QU">Caleb
                    Hyles</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6nT7RjBCuuggrafnb43vUX">and
                    Lauren Babic</a></p>
